Footnotes:
1,"The data source for this table is the final version of the T1 Family File, created by the Centre for Income and Socio-Economic Well-being Statistics of Statistics Canada. Because they are based on a different methodology, estimates of the number of individuals and census families presented in this table differ from estimates produced by the Centre for Demography. Information on the data source, the historical availability, definitions of the terms used, and the geographies available can be found at <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/72-212-X" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Technical Reference Guide for the Annual Income Estimates for Census Families, Individuals and Seniors <span class="wb-inv"> - opens in a new browser window</span></a>."
2,"Family after-tax income is the sum of the after-tax incomes of all members of the census family. A detailed definition of after-tax income is available from the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/72-212-X" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Technical Reference Guide for the Annual Income Estimates for Census Families, Individuals and Seniors <span class="wb-inv"> - opens in a new browser window</span></a>."
3,"Low income situation of individuals is determined using the Census Family Low Income After-Tax Measure (CFLIM-AT).  Individuals are defined as having low income if their adjusted after-tax income falls below 50% of the total population median adjusted after-tax income. Adjusted after-tax income is derived by dividing census family income by the square root of the census family size and assigning this value to all persons in the census family. This adjustment distributes income among the members of the census family, and takes into account the economies of scale present in larger families, the increasing number of people living on their own and the decline in family size over time."
4,"Characteristics such as age are as of December 31 of the reference year."
5,"Family units include census families and persons not in census families. Census families are comprised of: 1) couples (married or common-law, including same-sex couples) living in the same dwelling with or without children, and 2) single parents (male or female) living with one or more children. Persons who are not matched to a family become persons not in census families. They may be living alone, with a family to whom they are related, with a family to whom they are unrelated or with other persons not in census families."
6,"A couple family consists of a couple living together (married or common-law, including same-sex couples) living at the same address with or without children."
7,"A lone-parent family is a family with only one parent, male or female, and with at least one child."
8,"A person not in census families is an individual who is not part of a census family (couple family or lone-parent family). Persons not in census families may live with their married children or with their children who have children of their own. They may be living with a family to whom they are related or unrelated. They may also be living alone or with other non-family persons."
9,"The information in this table is based on the updated methodology for Census Family Low Income After-Tax Measure (CFLIM-AT) statistics derived from the T1 Family File. The updated methodology was introduced in April 2018. Statistics based on the former methodology can be found in CANSIM table 111-0015. For more information on methodological changes, please consult the research paper <a href=" https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/en/catalogue/75F0002M2018001" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Methodology Changes: Census Family Low Income Measure Based on the T1 Family File <span class="wb-inv"> - opens in a new browser window</span></a> (75F0002M2018001)."
10,"The Census Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) is used for data dissemination of the Census Metropolitan Areas and the Census Agglomerations: from 2004 to 2006, SGC 2001; from 2007 to 2011, SGC 2006; as of 2012, SGC 2011; as of 2016, SGC 2016. Please note that Census Agglomerations were introduced in this CANSIM table in 2008."
11,"As of 2020, COVID benefits are included in income estimates. For more information, consult the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/72-212-X" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Technical Reference Guide for the Annual Income Estimates for Census Families, Individuals and Seniors <span class="wb-inv"> - opens in a new browser window</span></a>."
12,"Children are tax filers or imputed persons in couple and lone-parent families. Tax filing children do not live with their spouse, have no children of their own and live with their parent(s). Most children are identified from a file pertaining to Federal Child Benefits, a provincial births file or a previous T1 family file."
13,"The Average Low-income Gap Ratio is calculated as follows. First, a gap ratio is computed for all individuals in low income. The gap ratio is the difference between the low-income measure and the adjusted census family income of the individual, expressed as a percentage of the low-income measure. For those with negative income, the gap ratio is set to 100%. Second, the Average Low-income Gap Ratio is computed as the average gap ratio for all individuals in low income."
